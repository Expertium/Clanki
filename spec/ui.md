# User interface modes

## ui.mode-switch

Given a collection, the interface is in Simple mode unless the collection flag
`advancedUi` is on. The mode is switched from a two-state control that reads
"Simple | Advanced" with the active side filled, placed in the right tray of
the main-window toolbar (top right), and from View > Advanced UI
(Ctrl+Shift+U); both write the flag at once and redraw the toolbar and, on
the deck list, the bottom row from the tree already on screen. The switch
never recomputes the due counts: the mode does not affect dueness, so a
full main-window reset (which would rebuild the RWKV counts, slowly and
with "…" placeholders meanwhile) is not done. In
Simple mode the deck list's bottom row shows Find Decks Online (the button
formerly named "Get Shared") and Create Deck but not Import File (Import
stays under File); these buttons share one width in both modes, the
deck menu (the gear next to a deck) has no RWKV submenu (Reschedule With
RWKV-Curve, Reschedule All Decks), Tools > Add-ons is shown in both modes,
and the deck-options screen shows its simplified view
(`spec/deck-options.md`, `deck-options.advanced-view`) with no switch of its
own. Hidden settings keep their stored values and keep taking effect.

**Why:** plan item 2 — the Simplified/Advanced split in the SuperMemo style,
Simple by default; Andrew, 2026-09-14, chose the toolbar placement with the
active side filled. The RWKV reschedule actions are power-user tools. A user
with add-ons must reach them in Simple mode too (Andrew, 2026-09-15: the
entry is always shown; an earlier rule hid it while no add-on was
installed).

**Pinned by:** `qt/tests/test_ui_mode.py` (toggle markup, click handling,
deck-browser row, the RWKV submenu, the switch redrawing without a full
reset),
`advanced_ui_flag_is_reported` (`rslib/src/deckconfig/update.rs`).

## ui.review-heatmap

Given the collection flag `reviewHeatmapEnabled` on (the default), Clanki
draws a review heatmap — the Review Heatmap add-on (Glutanimate, AGPLv3)
made native: a calendar of reviews per day with the due forecast in a
second colour, previous / today / next navigation, and four figures
(daily average on active days, share of days with activity since the first
review, longest streak, current streak, which counts only while the last
active day is today or yesterday). It shows under the deck list (the whole
collection, minus the excluded decks), on the deck overview (the current
deck and its subdecks) and above the legacy stats report (Shift+click
Stats; the chosen deck or the collection, over the last month, year or the
whole history). Days are grouped in local time with the "next day starts
at" hour applied. Clicking a past day opens the browser on
`prop:rated=-N` (with `deck:current` prefixed where the heatmap covers one
deck); a future day, `prop:due=N`.

Its settings are in Preferences > Review Heatmap, a tab of its own: the
on/off switch; the color scheme (lime, olive, ice, magenta, flame; magenta
by default) and the calendar mode (yearly overview or a continuous
nine-month timeline); where the calendar shows (main screen, deck screen,
stats screen) and whether the four figures show even where it is hidden;
a history limit and a forecast limit in days, and a date before which
reviews are ignored (these three apply to the main and deck screens); to
exclude deleted cards and manual reschedules (ease 0) from the history (the
latter on by default); and decks left out of the main-screen heatmap, with
their subdecks. The settings are stored in the collection config under
`reviewHeatmap` and sync. Until they are first saved, the add-on's stored
settings are used (its `heatmap` collection config and profile entries),
except a color scheme left at the add-on's own default. The heatmap's gear
opens the tab; Shift+click on the gear cycles the color scheme and
Shift+click on "today" cycles the calendar mode. With the switch off, or
where neither the calendar nor the figures show, nothing is computed.

Given the Review Heatmap add-on installed and enabled at start-up, Clanki
disables it before add-ons load (both would draw a heatmap) and, the first
time only, tells the user so once the profile is open; the notice is never
shown again (a flag in the profile manager's global meta).

**Why:** Andrew, 2026-09-15: integrate the add-on natively with all its
settings, in a Preferences tab of their own, magenta by default, and retire
the add-on with a one-time notice.

day map, settings parsing and defaults, the carry-over from the add-on,
colors, modes and visibility, the stats-screen period and scope, the
render cache, the browser search, the Shift+click cycling, the settings
link, disabling the add-on, the one-time notice);
